# PYTHON-Editor

***

## Simple Python Editor <br>
1) a python editting app: write code, run code, open and save files, find and replace text, clear screen, etc.<br><br>
2) the files in the STEPS/ directory are a series of adding functionality, culminating in gui.py<br><br>
3) the files were added to an .exe using auto-py-to-exe,found in /PACKAGE_GUI/output/gui.exe<br>
   --for some reason auto-py-to-exe doesn't want to package the icon file, which is also in that dir<br>
   --without the icon file it errors out, the icon can be removed and the package re-generated, however as it stands the file is requried<br>
